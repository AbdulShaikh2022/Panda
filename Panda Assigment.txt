Q1. How do you load a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame?
Answer- Using the Pandas Library. import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv("bwq.csv") data.

Q2. How do you check the data type of a column in a Pandas DataFrame?
Answer- To check the data type in pandas DataFrame we can use the “dtype” attribute. 
The attribute returns a series with the data type of each column. And the column names of the DataFrame are represented as the index of the resultant series object and the corresponding data types are returned as values of the series object.

Q3. How do you select rows from a Pandas DataFrame based on a condition?
Answer- Pandas is built on top of the Python Numpy library and has two primarydata structures viz. one dimensional Series and two dimensional DataFrame . Pandas DataFrame can handle both homogeneous and heterogeneous data . 
Wecan perform basic operations on Pandas DataFrame rows like selecting, deleting, adding, and renaming.
Q4. How do you rename columns in a Pandas DataFrame?

Q5. How do you drop columns in a Pandas DataFrame?
Anser- To Delete a column from a Pandas DataFrame or Drop one or more than one column from a DataFrame can be achieved in multiple ways. 

Q6. How do you find the unique values in a column of a Pandas DataFrame?
Anser- To select the unique values from a specific column in a Pandas dataframe you can use the unique() method. 
This is simply appended to the end of the column name, e.g. df['column_name']. unique() and returns a Python list of the unique values.

Q7. How do you find the number of missing values in each column of a Pandas DataFrame?
Anser - To get the count of missing values in each column of a dataframe, you can use the pandas isnull() and sum() functions together. The following is the syntax:
# count of missing values in each column
df.isnull().sum()

Q8. How do you fill missing values in a Pandas DataFrame with a specific value?
Anser- Missing Data can occur when no information is provided for one or more items or for a whole unit. Missing Data is a very big problem in a real-life scenarios. Missing Data can also refer to as NA(Not Available) values in pandas.
In DataFrame sometimes many datasets simply arrive with missing data, either because it exists and was not collected or it never existed.

Q9. How do you concatenate two Pandas DataFrames?
Answer- A concatenation of two or more data frames can be done using pandas.concat() method. concat() in pandas works by combining Data Frames across rows or columns. We can concat two or more data frames either along rows  (axis=0) or along columns (axis=1)

Q10. How do you merge two Pandas DataFrames on a specific column?
Answer-We can merge two Pandas DataFrames on certain columns using the merge function by simply specifying the certain columns for merge. 

Q11. How do you group data in a Pandas DataFrame by a specific column and apply an aggregation function?
Answer- Pandas DataFrame merge() function is used to merge two DataFrame objects with a database-style join operation. The joining is performed on columns or indexes. 
If the joining is done on columns, indexes are ignored. This function returns a new DataFrame and the source DataFrame objects are unchanged.

Q12. How do you pivot a Pandas DataFrame?
Answer -n Pandas, we use the pivot_table() function to generate pivot tables. Pandas' pivot_table() methods provide a fill_value argument, which we can use to fill all of the NaN values in our DataFrame before doing any computations.

Q13. How do you change the data type of a column in a Pandas DataFrame?
Answer- DataFrame.astype() method is used to cast pandas object to a specified dtype.This function also provides the capability to convert any suitable existing column to a categorical type.

Q14. How do you sort a Pandas DataFrame by a specific column?
Answer-To sort the DataFrame based on the values in a single column, we will use . sort_values() . By default, this will return a new DataFrame sorted in ascending order. It does not modify the original DataFrame. 

Q15. How do you create a copy of a Pandas DataFrame?
Answer- The copy() method returns a copy of the DataFrame. By default, the copy is a "deep copy" meaning that any changes made in the original DataFrame will NOT be reflected in the copy.

Q16. How do you filter rows of a Pandas DataFrame by multiple conditions?Answer-o filter Pandas DataFrame by multiple conditions use DataFrame. loc[] property along with the conditions. 
Answer - By using df[], loc[], query(), eval() and numpy.where() we can filter Pandas DataFrame by multiple conditions. The process of applying multiple filter conditions in Pandas DataFrame is one of the most frequently performed tasks while manipulating data. 
Pandas provide several techniques to retrieve subsets of data from the DataFrame efficiently.

Q17. How do you calculate the mean of a column in a Pandas DataFrame?
Answer- To calculate the mean of whole columns in the DataFrame, use pandas. Series. mean() with a list of DataFrame columns. You can also get the mean for all numeric columns using

Q18. How do you calculate the standard deviation of a column in a Pandas DataFrame?
Answer - we'll use the std() method to calculate the standard deviation of all columns in the DataFrame. To do this, you simply append the std() method to the DataFrame object. 
It returns a Series object with the standard deviation of each column.

Q19. How do you calculate the correlation between two columns in a Pandas DataFrame?
Answer- We can see the correlation between two columns of pandas DataFrame by using DataFrame. corr() function.

Q20. How do you select specific columns in a DataFrame using their labels?
Answer- There are 3 methord for doining it :-
Method 1: Select One Column by Name df. loc[:, 'column1']
Method 2: Select Multiple Columns by Name df. loc[:, ['column1', 'column3', 'column4']]
Method 3: Select Columns in Range by Name df. loc[:, 'column2':'column4']

Q21. How do you select specific rows in a DataFrame using their indexes?
Answer- You can select a single row from pandas DataFrame by integer index using df. iloc[n] . Replace n with a position you wanted to select.

Q22. How do you sort a DataFrame by a specific column?
Answer- Sorting Your DataFrame on a Single Column. To sort the DataFrame based on the values in a single column, you'll use . sort_values() . By default, this will return a new DataFrame sorted in ascending order.

Q23. How do you create a new column in a DataFrame based on the values of another column?
Answer - We can add/append a new column to the DataFrame based on the values of another column using df.assign(), df.apply(), and, np.where() functions and return a new Dataframe after adding a new column.

Q24. How do you remove duplicates from a DataFrame?
Answer-The drop_duplicates() method removes duplicate rows. Use the subset parameter if only some specified columns should be considered when looking for duplicates.

Q25. What is the difference between .loc and .iloc in Pandas?
Answer- Loc and iloc are two functions in Pandas that are used to slice a data set in a Pandas DataFrame. The function . loc is typically used for label indexing and can access multiple columns, while . iloc is used for integer indexing
